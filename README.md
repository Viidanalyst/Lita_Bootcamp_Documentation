### INSIGHTS DRAWN
From the dashboard, some insights drawn are as follows;
- The Parts line of business has the most sales follwed by the Service plan line of business.
- The North East Region generated the most revenue and has the most units sold. This also explains why the East markets and stores generated the most revenue.
- The North Central region generated the least revenue.

### INSIGHTS DRAWN
- From the dashboard above, i noticed a trend. The North East region dominated sales in both years. 
- Also, the sales of Parts has the most units sold, followed by service plans.
- Lastly, the North Central region still has the least units sold and generated the least revenue.
----
### GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
From the dashboard it is safe to say that the sales of Parts is well dominated in the North Eastern part of Nigeria, which also explains the top stores and markets being from the East.
The low sales in the North Central could be as a result of the high level of insecurities in that region and also it could be that the line of business is not vast in the area and the population are more focused in other businesses.
